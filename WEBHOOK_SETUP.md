ðŸš€ Your GitHub Webhook Setup

Your Appwrite Function is deployed at:
**https://68b56cd6001c18ae632c.fra.appwrite.run**

## Quick Setup Steps:

### 1. Add webhook to your main repository:
1. Go to: https://github.com/andamagodwin/Commitly-Mobile/settings/hooks
2. Click "Add webhook"
3. Payload URL: `https://68b56cd6001c18ae632c.fra.appwrite.run`
4. Content type: `application/json`
5. Select "Just the push event"
6. Click "Add webhook"

### 2. Add to any other repositories where you want points:
Repeat the same process for any other repos where you make commits.

### 3. Test it:
1. Make a commit to any repository with the webhook
2. Check your app - points should update automatically!
3. Check Appwrite Functions logs if needed

## What happens now:
- âœ… Manual "Check for Commits" button removed
- âœ… Real-time updates via webhooks working
- âœ… Points awarded automatically (+25 per commit)
- âœ… UI updates live without refreshing

The app now relies entirely on real-time webhook-based point awarding!
